    "### IMPORTANT NOTES\n",
    "1. This lab revolves around a single application area (resizing images), which is described below as the introduction to the lab.\n",
    "3. This lab looks very long. Do not despair! It contains a lot of optional material and a lot of text to read. This makes it look much longer than it is.\n",

    "##### Motivation\n",
    "We often want to resize images (say, for different screen sizes/resolutions). A standard solution to making an image smaller would be to just discard some of the pixels. For example, if we want to make the image exactly half its original width and height, we can cut up the images into $2\\times 2$ squares and just keep the upper-left pixel in each square. But what if you want to reduce the size of the image by 30%? Or, what if you want to change the aspect ratio of the image without distoring the image contents? Now things get more complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will explore a technique called _seam carving_. If you are interested, you can check out the 2007 paper by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir [_Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing_](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~connelly/class/2013/cs6501/proj2/seamcarving.pdf). As the title of the paper suggests, this algorithm is about \"content-aware\" image resizing, which means that the pixels we add/remove are chosen based on the content itself. With seam carving, we can resize to any size, not just nice integer fractions like double or half.\n",
    " \n",
    "Note: we will consider only the problem of making an image smaller. Seam carving can also be used to make an image larger but we skip that here in the interests of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### What's the basic idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "Seam carving works by removing _seams_, one at a time. What is a seam? A _vertical seam_ is a connected path from the top to the bottom of the image, where the seam contains one pixel in each row. Similarly, a _horizontal seam_ is a connected path from the left to the right of the image, where the seam contains one pixel in each column. Below are some examples showing horizontal and vertical seams. \n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: a connected (vertical) path is a sequence of pixels, one per row, such that each pair of adjacent pixels are at most one column apart. And likewise for connected horizontal paths. See image: a vertical seam and a horizontal seam are shown in red, on top of the original image. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://www.ulfdittmer.com/imagej/imret-Im1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Seam carving works by repeatedly removing (or adding) seams until the desired size is achieved. You do not need to worry about this part: you are  provided with the function `seam_carve` that takes in an image and a desired size, and calls `find_horizontal_seam` and `find_vertical_seam` until the desired size is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How do we assess the quality of a seam? \n",
    "Seam carving works by defining an _energy function_, which is a proxy for how important each pixel is. You do not need to think about or understand this! Instead, we provide you with a function `energy` that takes in an image and returns an array of the same size containing the energy values. For those who are interested in what makes a good energy function, you can refer to the original paper (the basic idea is that when pixel intensities vary more rapidly, this indicates a more important part of the image, and thus higher energy). Next, assuming you have the energy in hand, a vertical or horizontal seam is simply the minimum energy path from top to bottom, or left to right, respectively. Note that for a path to be valid, it must be connected, meaning that all pixels in the path must be neighbours. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the three parts below, you will consider three different methods for finding the best seam out of all possible seams. You will discover that there are many ways of solving the same problem, and some are much better than others!\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you are provided with the following functions:\n",
    "  * `energy` \n",
    "  * `seam_carve` \n",
    "  * `remove_vertical_seam`\n",
    "  * `remove_horizontal_seam`\n",
    "  * `find_horizontal_seam`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should understand what they do, but you do not need to understand how they work (this is the beauty of functions!). \n",
    "\n",
    "You are also provided with some test code that generates a random tiny image. We use a random tiny image because the recursive solution is so slow that you wouldn't be able to test the code on any real images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below doesn't run (yet) because it's missing the `find_vertical_seam` function, which is what you will be working on.\n"

But, actually, this particular problem has more special structure beyond being linear. Loosely speaking, it is a bunch of sequential decisions, where the total objective is the sum of mini-objectives incurred by each decision (total energy = sum of individual seam pixel energies). This means we can use dynamic programming (DP). Hooray!\n",

But for the next row, at location $(2,j)$, you might have arrived there from 3 possible places, namely $(1,j-1)$, $(1,j)$, or $(1,j+1$). You will need to take this into consideration.

    "In part 3 you took things as far as they will go with better algorithms. But you still might not be satisfied with the performance. The next step is to optimize the implementation of the dynamic programming algorithm. A typical approach would be to ditch Python; while R might not be much faster (maybe it's slower?), other languages like C or perhaps Julia would speed things up. Another approach would be to use parallel computing, in which multiple threads of computation are performed at once (more on this in DSCI 525!). However, changing languages and parallelization are not always the only way. In part 3, you presumably implemented your forward pass with a nested `for` loop over the rows and columns of the image. However, certain languages (Python's NumPy, R, Matlab, etc.) do _vectorized_ operations much faster than loops. See below for an example:"

    "If you made it here and did all the parts, stop and reflect on how interesting this all is. You tried 4 approaches and (at least for me), each one is _significantly_ faster than the previous. Amazing! For the first three (recursive, LP, DP), the improvement was due to a better algorithm that takes advantage of the specific structure of the problem we are solving. The fourth case (vectorization) is the same algorithm but with a better implementation. This takes advantage of the details of how Python works. Don't forget, some problems can only be solved by enumerating all possibilities (approach 1). Those are the bad ones. Other problems are linear and can leverage LP but aren't DP problems (e.g. scheduling TAs for MDS labs given their availability, expertise, etc.). The big lesson is that you should understand the structure of your problem so that you can use the best possible algorithm. This might be the difference between your code taking 1 hour vs. 1 week.  "
