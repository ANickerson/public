## Guide to Rubrics ##

These small rubrics are intended to be used together to judge individual assignments. Most assignments are to be graded with several weighted rubrics added together.

All rubrics are intended to be orthogonal, and, as such, completely modularizable. The scope of any two rubrics should not overlap.

The rubrics are:

- (code) [accuracy](rubric_accuracy.md)
- (code) [quality](rubric_quality.md)
- (code) [efficiency](rubric_efficiency.md)
- [autograde](rubric_autograde.md)

- [mechanics](rubric_mech.md)
- [reasoning](rubric_reasoning.md)
