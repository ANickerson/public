    <td>Did not attempt</td>
    <td>Code fails to run, doesn't have clear output, or performs the wrong task.</td>
    <td>Code performs only some of the correct tasks, the output is not easily understandable and the methods used to achieve the result are inefficient (if performance is a concern).</td>
    <td>Code performs most of the correct tasks, the output is understandable, however the methods used to achieve the result are inefficient (if performance is a concern). </td>  
    <td>Code performs the correct tasks, the output is reasonably easy to understand, however the methods used to achieve the result are not the most efficient (if performance is a concern).</td>
    <td>Code runs correctly without crashing, the output is very clear, and the intended or suitably correct methods are employed to achieve the correct result. Student has chosen the most efficient algorithm reasonable if performance is a concern.</td>
