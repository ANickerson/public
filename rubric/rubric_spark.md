## Grading Rubric for Spark ##

This rubric is intended to reward students who put time and effort into overcoming unexpected problems, or who go above and beyond in some way. Almost all assignments are eligible for bonus marks or deductions based on "spark." Therefore, consider including notes about problems they encountered and how you overcame them if you did put significant work into it.
