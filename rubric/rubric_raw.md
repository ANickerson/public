## Grading Rubric for raw grades ##

With this rubric, unlike all other rubrics, **the score will not be scaled depending on the weight of the question**. For example, if you give a "10" with this rubric, and the question is out of 10, they will get 10/10 or 100%. But if the question is out of 20, they will get 10/20 or 50%. Etc.
