   <td>Not attempted.</td>
   <td>Submission does not address question asked or makes no sense.</td>
    
   <td>Submission lacks a purpose, little to no understanding of the learning material is displayed, important information is lacking. The text may contradict itself, or obvious gaps in the argument are present. <br/><br/>In the case of short-answer questions, the incorrect answer was attained and the wrong method was used.
<br/><br/> Analysis is lacking (if it is required).
<br/><br/> Reasoning is flawed or insufficient, does not accurately back up claim, or no clear thesis established.
<br/><br/> Structure of argument is confusing and poorly laid-out; if this is a written submission, the reader may have to jump back and forth through the text. Any figures included are not labelled clearly or sensibly.
</td>
   
    
   <td>There is purpose to the submission, some understanding of the learning material is demonstrated.
<br/><br/>In the case of short-answer questions, the correct or approximately correct method was used.
<br/><br/> Analysis is mostly correct but may be lacking in-depth.
<br/><br/> Thesis, arguments and reasoning are present but do not strongly back up the thesis.
<br/><br/> Structure of argument is somewhat clear. Paragraph delineation could be improved (if this is a written submission). Included figures labels need more clarity/could be better.
</td>
    <td>There is a clear purpose to the submission, understanding of the learning material is demonstrated.
<br/><br/>In the case of short-answer questions, the correct or approximately correct method was used.
<br/><br/> Analysis is correct and sufficiently in-depth if required.
<br/><br/> Thesis is clear and the arguments and reasoning presented back up the thesis well.
<br/><br/> Structure of argument is clear and delineated sensibly into paragraphs if this is a written submission. Included figures are labelled clearly and sensibly.
</td>
    <td>Mastery of the learning material is demonstrated, original ideas may be presented.
<br/><br/>In the case of short-answer questions, the correct method was used and the correct result attained.
<br/><br>Analysis is thorough and exhaustive without being drawn out or lacking focus.
<br/><br/>Thesis is clear and the arguments that support it are flawless and very well-reasoned, leaving no obvious gaps.
<br/><br/> Structure of argument is very clear and straightforward; in the case of a written submisison, the reader almost never has to jump back and forth unless clearly instructed to do so by references.
