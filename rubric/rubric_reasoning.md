The text may contradict itself, or obvious gaps in the argument are present. <br/><br/>In the case of short-answer questions, the incorrect answer was attained and the wrong method was used.
<br/><br/> Analysis is lacking if it is required.
<br/><br/> Reasoning is flawed or insufficient, does not accurately back up claim, or no clear thesis established.
<br/><br/> Structure of argument is confusing and poorly laid-out; if this is a written submission, the reader may have to jump back and forth through the text. Any figures included are not labelled clearly or sensibly.
