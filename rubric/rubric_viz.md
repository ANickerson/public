    <td>Visualization has nothing to do with the intended task.</td>
    <td>Visual channels are mismatched with attribute characteristics and scale.<br><br>Axis labels, titles, and
legends are missing or incorrect.<br><br>Low-level detail is provided without
sufficient overview.<br><br>Missed opportunities to transform data into more suitable form.<br><br>Intended tasks are poorly supported.<br><br>Poor information density. <br><br>Design choices appear arbitrary.
</td>
    
  <td>Some visual channels are matched with attribute characteristics and scale.<br><br>Several axis labels, titles, and
legends are missing or incorrect.<br><br>Overviews do not mislead.<br><br>Some data is derived with appropriate
data transformations.<br><br>Some intended tasks are mostly supported.<br><br>Display has major clutter or is overly sparse.<br><br>Only some design decisions are effective.
