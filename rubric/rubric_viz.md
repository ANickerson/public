## Grading Rubric for Visualizations 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>No Attempt (0&nbsp;points)</th>
    <th>Poor (1&nbsp;point)</th>
    <th>Satisfactory (2&nbsp;points)</th>
    <th>Excellent (3&nbsp;points)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not Attempted</td>
    <td>Visual channels are mismatched with attribute characteristics.<br><br>Axes and
legends are missing or incorrect.<br><br>Low-level detail is provided without
sufficient overview.<br><br>Intended tasks are poorly supported.<br><br>Design choices
are arbitrary rather than justified.
</td>
    <td>Most design decisions are effective, with only a few minor
mismatches. Overviews do not mislead. Some data is derived with appropriate
data transformations. Display has minor clutter or is overly sparse.
</td>
    <td>All visual channels including spatial position and color are correctly
matched with attributes according to expressiveness with respect to
categorical and quantitative data, and with effectiveness criteria with
respect to perceptual accuracy and the number of distinguishable bins
required.<br><br>All axes and legends are present and suitable.<br><br>Comprehensible
overviews provide hints on potentially interesting areas to explore
further.<br><br>Appropriate data transformations are chosen to compute derived
data.<br><br>Information density is good.
