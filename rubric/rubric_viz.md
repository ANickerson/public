    <td>Not Attempted</td>
    <td>Visual channels are mismatched with attribute characteristics and scale.<br><br>Axes and
legends are missing or incorrect.<br><br>Low-level detail is provided without
sufficient overview.<br><br>Missed opportunities to transform data into more suitable form.<br><br>Intended tasks are poorly supported.<br><br>Poor information density. <br><br>Design choices appear arbitrary.
</td>
    <td>Most visual channels are well matched with attribute characteristics and scale.<br><br>Some axes and
legends are missing or incorrect.<br><br>Overviews do not mislead.<br><br>Some data is derived with appropriate
data transformations.<br><br>Intended tasks are mostly supported.<br><br>Display has minor clutter or is overly sparse.<br><br>Most design decisions are effective.
</td>
    <td>All visual channels are well matched with attribute characteristics and scale.<br><br>All axes and legends are present and suitable.<br><br>Comprehensible
overviews provide hints on potentially interesting areas to explore
further.<br><br>Appropriate data transformations are chosen to compute derived
data.<br><br>Intended tasks are well supported.<br><br>Information density is good.<br><br>Design choices follow best practices.
