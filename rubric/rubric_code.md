## Grading Rubric for Code ##

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>No attempt (0&nbsp;points)</th>
    <th>Poor (1&nbsp;point)</th>
    <th>Satisfactory (2&nbsp;points)</th>
	<th>Excellent (3&nbsp;points)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Accuracy (60%)</th>
	<td>Did not attempt</td>
    <td>Code fails to run, doesn't have clear output, or performs the wrong task.</td>
    <td>Code performs most of the correct tasks, the output is reasonably easy to understand, the correct result is attained, and the methods used to achieve the result are not inefficient.</td>
    <td>Code runs correctly without crashing, the output is very clear, and the intended or suitably correct methods are employed to achieve the correct result. Student has chosen the most efficient algorithm reasonable if performance is a concern.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Readability and Documentation (20%)</th>
	<td>Did not attempt</td>
    <td>Code uses unclear variable names, has a confusing structure, has far too little or far too much whitespace and lacks comments and documentation.</td>
    <td>Code is straightforward to read and understand most of the time, comments are used when necessary, and variable names are not confusing or misleading. Code is well-organized.</td>
    <td>Code is easy to read and understand, variable names are clear, an appropriate amount of whitespace is used to maximize visibility, tabs and spaces are not mixed for indentation, and sufficient comments are given. Overall, the code is very well-documented. <br/> <br/> Any coding sections of the assignment that were not completed have documentation explaining what a coded solution would look like.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Robustness and Maintainability (20%)</th>
	<td>Did not attempt</td>
    <td>Difficult problems were not broken down into functions; exceedingly long one-liners are present; sections of code are duplicated rather than repurposed into a function; "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic numbers</a>" are present.</td>
    <td>Functions are used to break down difficult problems or to reuse solutions to similar problems; loops are employed well.</td>
    <td>The code is neatly decoupled into functions or classes or files as needed without becoming overly complicated; functions are short, concise, and cohesive without losing clarity; code can be easily modified without requiring "<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_surgerya>shotgun surgery</a>." <BR/><br/>Functions handle edge cases correctly, exceptions are caught and thrown if necessary, testing suite may even be present.</td>

In addition, code may be evaluated for [the evaluator's ability to run it correctly](./rubric_mech.md) or [creative problem solving ability](./rubric_spark.md) among [other factors](./README.MD).
