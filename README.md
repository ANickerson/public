# UBC MDS public materials

This repository contains publicly available versions of some of the teaching materials from the UBC MDS program. We intend to make
more of the materials public over time. Our current plan is to post the homework assignments (a.k.a. labs) and the lecture notes for a selection of courses. We do not plan to post lab solutions or quizzes at this time. Please follow the links below to our currently available material:

- [DSCI 512: Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/tree/master/courses/512_alg-data-struct) (labs)
